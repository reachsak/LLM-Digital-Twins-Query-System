# TwinGPT: LLM-Digital-Twins-Query-System


## Project Overview

**TwinGPT** is an AI-powered digital twin query system designed for facility managers to interact with and extract insights from building data using a large language model (LLM). This system integrates static data, such as BIM (Building Information Modeling) details such as Rooms, Levels, and building assets, with dynamic data from sensors, environmental inputs, and occupancy information. It provides an intuitive interface for querying both historical and real-time building data. The platform offers an interactive AI chatbot, enabling facility managers to ask questions or converse with the AI assistant to retrieve relevant building information quickly and efficiently. TwinGPT supports queries that span static BIM data and dynamic inputs, such as sensor readings, environmental conditions, and occupancy metrics. This platform is powered by the open-source AI system Llama 3.2, powered by the `llama.cpp` framework.
